	Leonard		goodnight , sheldon .
	Sheldon		but how am i going to get to work ?
	Leonard		take the bus .
	Sheldon		i can’t take the bus any more . they don’t have seatbelts . and they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords .
	Leonard		you tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords ?
	Sheldon		i didn’t try , i succeeded . for some reason it alarmed the other passengers and i was asked to de-bus .
	Leonard		oh , you’re a big boy , you’ll figure it out .
	Sheldon		don’t talk to me like i’m a child . now , take me to return my star wars sheets !
