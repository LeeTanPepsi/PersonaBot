Leonard::Goodnight, Sheldon.
Sheldon::But how am I going to get to work?
Leonard::Take the bus.
Sheldon::I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
Leonard::You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
Sheldon::I didn’t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.
Leonard::Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out.
Sheldon::Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!
