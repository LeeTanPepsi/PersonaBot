Stan::Goodnight, Sheldon.
Cartman::But how am I going to get to work?
Stan::Take the bus.
Cartman::I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
Stan::You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
Cartman::I didn’t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.
Stan::Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out.
Cartman::Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!
