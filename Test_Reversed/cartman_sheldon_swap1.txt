Leonard::Come on, people. Come on, people now. 
Sheldon::Dude, what are you doing?
Leonard::I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
Sheldon::THAT's gay, heh.
Leonard::Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
Sheldon::Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
Leonard::You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
Sheldon::Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew!
